## Project Title

GBDA302 Week 2 Example 1: Blob (Breathing Animation)

## Authors
Original example: Karen Cochrane and David Han
Redesign / extension: Lynette Shen

## Description

This project started from the Week 2 Example 1 “Blob (Breathing Animation)” and was redesigned into a small interactive p5.js mini-game. The blob keeps its organic, noise-driven breathing/w

---

## Learning Goals

Understand and apply the setup() / draw() structure in p5.js to manage continuous animation and multiple game states
Build and manipulate a custom organic shape using polar coordinates and vertex-based drawing
Use noise() to create smooth, organic motion and emotional variation in an animated form
Extend a static animation into an interactive system by introducing user input, state changes, and win conditions
Practice structuring code for readability and scalability when adding new mechanics and screens

## a summary
GenAI (ChatGPT 5.2) was used as a supportive tool to help redesign and extend the original example code. It assisted with brainstorming new mechanics, restructuring the code into clear game states (intro, gameplay, end), and debugging logic and layout issues. Human judgement guided all final decisions, including which features to include, how interactions should work, and how the game should align with assignment goals. GenAI outputs were tested, modified, and refined through iterative implementation and playtesting.
